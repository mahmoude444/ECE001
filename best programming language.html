<h1 style="text-align:center;">Best Programming Languages</h1>
<p>
<br>           <br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Python:</li>
<br>         <br>
Python is one of the most used programming languages ​​today and is an easy language for beginners to learn due to its ease of reading.<br> It is a free open source programming language with extensive support modules and community development, easy integration with web services, user-friendly data structures, and graphical user interface-based desktop applications.<br> It is a common programming language for machine learning and deep learning applications.<br> Python is used to develop 2-D imaging packages and 3D animation such as Blender, Inkscape and Autodesk.<br> It has also been used to create popular video games, including Civilization IV, Vegas Trike and Toontown.<br> Python is used for scientific and computer applications such as FreeCAD and Abacus, and is also used by popular websites such as YouTube, Quora, Pinterest and Instagram.<br> The approximate annual salary for a Python developer is $ 92,000.<br> 
 <br> <br>
 <li>Java:</li>
<br>              <br>
Java is one of the most common and required computer programming languages ​​used today.<br> This general purpose scripting language, owned by Oracle Corporation, with its object oriented architecture has become a standard for applications that can be used regardless of platform (such as Mac, Window, Android, iOS, etc.) <br> due to its one-time writing Anywhere Operating Capabilities (WORA) .<br> As a result of this capability, Java has been identified as being able to transfer across platforms from central data centers to smartphones.<br> Today, there are more than 3 billion devices running applications built with Java.<br>
Java is widely used in web and application development as well as big data.<br> Java is also used in the backend of many popular websites, including Google, Amazon, Twitter and YouTube.<br> It is also widely used in hundreds of applications.<br> New Java frameworks like Spring, Struts and Hibernate are also very popular.<br> With millions of Java developers around the world, there are hundreds of texts available to learn Java Programming.<br> Also, Java programmers actively participate in a variety of forums where they scan ideas or solve programming problems.<br> Java has a wide community and gets a lot of support.<br>
Although Java is a more sophisticated language to learn, experienced developers are the ones to demand.<br> A regular Java developer earns about 94,000 dollars.<br>  
  <br>   <br>
  <li> C (and C++): </li>
<br> <br>
C is perhaps the oldest commonly used programming language, and is the origin of other programming languages ​​like C #, Java, and JavaScript.<br> C ++ is an improved version of C.<br> Many developers today skip C learning alone, while others believe that C learning first provides valuable value for C ++ development.<br> Both languages ​​are widely used in computer science and programming.<br> C and C ++ developers can take advantage of translators for a variety of platforms, making applications developed in these languages ​​highly portable.<br> C and C ++ are high-performance languages.<br> As such, it is widely used in application development where performance is a critical issue, such as client / server applications, commercial products like Firefox and Adobe, and video games.<br> The average salary is about $ 91,000 a year.<br>
