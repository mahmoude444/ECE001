<br>                                                                   <br>
The programming language is an official language that includes a set of instructions that produce different types of outputs. <br>Programming languages ​​are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.<br>
Most programming languages ​​consist of instructions for computers.<br> There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, instead of general programming languages.<br> Before the invention of the digital computer, perhaps the first was the automatic flute that the Musa brothers described in Baghdad in the ninth century during the Islamic Golden Age.<br> Since the early nineteenth century, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as jacquard looms, music boxes, and player pianos.<br> Software of these devices (such as operator piano scripts) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or circumstances.<br>
Thousands of different programming languages ​​have been created, and more are created every year.<br> Many programming languages ​​are written inevitably (i.e., as a sequence of operations to be performed) while other languages ​​use the introductory model (i.e. the desired result is determined, not how to achieve it).<br>
The description of a programming language is usually divided into the components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).<br> Some languages ​​are defined by a specification document (for example, the programming language C is defined by the ISO standard) while other languages ​​(such as Perl) have a dominant application that is treated as a reference.<br> Some languages ​​have both, with the base language being defined with a standard and additions taken from the prevailing implementation are common.
